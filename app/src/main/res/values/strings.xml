    <string name="Recipe1">
        Ingredients:
        \n
        \n
        3 – 6 skinless, boneless chicken thighs \n
1 pound (450g) green beans, trimmed \n
3 tablespoons butter, divided or (ghee for paleo diet)\n
4 garlic cloves, minced\n
1 teaspoon paprika\n
1 teaspoon onion powder\n
1/4 teaspoon salt and fresh cracked black pepper\n
Juice of 1/2 lemon + lemon slices, for garnish\n
1/2 cup (125ml) chicken stock\n
1 tablespoon hot sauce (we used Sriracha)\n
1/4 teaspoon crushed red chili pepper flakes, optional\n
1/2 cup fresh chopped parsley\n
        \n

        DIRECTIONS\n
        \n
1. To make the lemon garlic butter chicken thighs recipe with green beans: In a small bowl, combine onion powder, paprika, salt, and pepper. Season chicken thighs generously with the spice mixture. Set aside while you prepare green beans.\n
        \n

2. Arrange green beans in a microwave-safe dish with 1/2 cup (125ml) water. Cook in the microwave for 8-10 minutes, until almost done but still crisp.\n
        \n

3. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Lay the seasoned chicken thighs in one layer in the skillet. Cook for 5-6 minutes then flip and cook another 5-6 minutes, until cooked through and a cooking thermometer displays 165°F (75°C). If chicken browns too quickly, lower the heat. Adjust timing depending on the thickness. Transfer chicken to a plate and set aside.\n
        \n

4. In the same skillet, lower the heat and melt the remaining tablespoon of butter. Add chopped parsley, garlic, hot sauce, red crushed chili pepper flakes, and pre-cooked green beans and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, stirring regularly, until cooked to your liking. Add lemon juice and chicken stock and reduce the sauce for a couple of minutes, until slightly thickened.\n
        \n

5. Add cooked chicken thighs back to the pan and reheat quickly. Adjust seasoning with pepper and serve the lemon garlic butter chicken thighs immediately, garnished with more crushed chili pepper, fresh parsley, and a slice of lemon if you like. Enjoy!\n

        INGREDIENTS LIST FOR THE SALMON AND ASPARAGUS FOIL PACKS\n
        \n

2 salmon fillets \n
2 tablespoons vegetable broth or chicken broth \n
1 1/2 tablespoon fresh lemon juice, or to taste\n
1 tablespoon of your favorite hot sauce (we used Sriracha)\n
4 teaspoons minced garlic (4 cloves)\n
Salt and fresh ground black pepper, to taste\n
3-4 tablespoons butter, diced into small cubes (or ghee)\n
2 tablespoons fresh chopped parsley or cilantro\n
1 lb (450g) medium-thick asparagus, woody ends trimmed\n
\n
        \n

        DIRECTIONS\n
        \n

1. To prepare the oven-baked salmon in foil packs: Preheat your oven to 425ºF (220ºC). Cut 2 sheets of 14 by 12-inch (35 x 30 cm) heavy-duty aluminum foil then lay each piece separately on the countertop. In a small bowl, combine the ingredients for the garlic butter sauce: broth, lemon juice, and hot sauce.\n
        \n

2. Season both sides of the salmon fillets with salt and pepper and divide salmon onto the aluminum foil near the center then place trimmed asparagus to one side of the salmon, following the long direction of the foil.\n
        \n

3. You can adjust salmon fillets seasoning with more salt and pepper, then sprinkle garlic on top. Drizzle the garlic butter sauce generously over the salmon fillets and asparagus.\n
        \n

4. Divide butter pieces evenly among the foil packets, layering them over the salmon fillet and asparagus.

5. Wrap salmon foil packets in and crimp edges together then wrap ends up. Don’t wrap too tight – keep a little extra space inside for heat to circulate.\n
        \n

6. Transfer the salmon foil packs to a baking sheet and bake salmon in the oven, sealed side upward until salmon has cooked through, about 9 – 12 minutes.\n
        \n

7. Carefully unwrap the baked salmon in foil packets then drizzle with more lemon juice and garnish with fresh parsley or cilantro and a slice of lemon. Enjoy!\n
